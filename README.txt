Plugins Used:
    - jquery-ui
    - smooth-scroll
    - tablesorter
    
I think my project is above and beyond in its look and feel. I focused a lot of time on making sure it was responsive (with three breakpoints) and looked very professional. I wrote clean code, and used plugins to enhance some of the aspects that I think can be improved upon on the current site. For example, when you click on a course from the minors section, instead of overlapping modals, having an accordion is another visually appealing solution. In addition, smooth-scrolling adds a nice touch to a site, and having the ability to sort the employment tables makes all of that data easier to look at by the user.
